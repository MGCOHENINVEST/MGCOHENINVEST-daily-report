# Daily Report System - Freeze Report (1 Sep 2025)

## Current Decisions
- HTML-only email
- Logo + tagline header (Kairos logo via S3 hosting)
- Title: Daily Report for Sir John Ritblat
- Timestamp auto-generated (06:00 GMT)
- Outlook blurb at top
- Sections: Rates, Indices, FX, News, Financial News, Watchlist (with sparklines), Company Announcements, Macro Announcements
- Watchlist: M&G, LGEN, Phoenix, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Metals Exploration
- Placeholders marked with (P)
- Recipient: test mode (your inbox)
- Subject line: Daily Report for Sir John Ritblat ‚Äî {date}

## ‚è∞ Cron Scheduling Example
To send the Daily Report automatically every day at 06:00 GMT, add the following line to your crontab:

0 6 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/send_report.py

- Ensure `daily_report_full.html` is in the same directory or update the path inside send_report.py.
- Adjust `/usr/bin/python3` if your Python binary is elsewhere.

## üîë SendGrid Variant
If you are using SendGrid instead of raw SMTP, your cron entry remains the same:

0 6 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/send_report.py

But inside `send_report.py`, swap out the SMTP section with:

from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail

message = Mail(
    from_email=FROM_EMAIL,
    to_emails=TO_EMAIL,
    subject=SUBJECT,
    html_content=html_body
)
sg = SendGridAPIClient("YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY")
sg.send(message)

- Replace "YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY" with your actual SendGrid API key.
- No SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASS needed when using SendGrid API client.

## üñº Hosting the Kairos Logo on S3
To host your Kairos logo for use in the Daily Report:

1. **Prepare the file**: Save as `kairos-logo.png` (small, web-friendly PNG/JPG).
2. **Upload to S3**:
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Create or select a bucket (e.g., `kairos-assets`).
   - Upload `kairos-logo.png`.
3. **Set permissions**:
   - In object settings, set ACL to allow public read access.
   - Confirm "Object URL" is available.
4. **Copy URL**: Example URL format:
   https://kairos-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kairos-logo.png
5. **Update HTML**: In `daily_report_full.html`, replace placeholder:
   <img src="LOGO_URL_HERE" alt="Kairos Logo" class="logo">
   with:
   <img src="https://kairos-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kairos-logo.png" alt="Kairos Logo" class="logo">

‚úÖ Your logo will now appear inline in every Daily Report.

## üîÑ Replacing Placeholders (P) with Live Data

In the current Daily Report, some sections show `(P)` where data feeds were not available.
These are intended to be replaced automatically once API integrations are in place.

### Company Announcements
- **Source**: Dividend and earnings feeds from EODHD (`getDividends`, `getFundamentals`).
- **Process**:
  1. Query each watchlist ticker for dividends in the relevant window.
  2. Query earnings calendars for result dates.
  3. Replace `(P)` lines in "Company Announcements This Week" with actual entries.
- **Example**:
  - Before: `M&G ‚Äî Interim Results (P)`
  - After:  `M&G ‚Äî Interim Results, 4 Sep 2025`

### Macro Announcements
- **Source**: Macro indicators (EODHD `getMacro`) or public calendars (FRED, central banks).
- **Process**:
  1. Pull upcoming events (NFP, CPI, ECB/BoE/Fed meetings).
  2. Map them into the "Macro Announcements This Week" section.
  3. Replace `(P)` placeholders with exact dates/labels.
- **Example**:
  - Before: `US CPI Release ‚Äî 12 Sep 2025 (P)`
  - After:  `US CPI Release ‚Äî 12 Sep 2025`

### Automation Strategy
- Extend backend script (`send_report.py`) to run data fetch before assembling HTML.
- Insert fetched data into placeholders dynamically at runtime.
- Keep `(P)` as fallback only if feed fails.

‚úÖ This ensures reports evolve from semi-static to fully data-driven without manual edits.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Data-Fetch Workflow (Pseudo-code)

To replace placeholders `(P)` and make the Daily Report fully automated, extend the backend as follows:

```python
# 1. Import clients
from eodhd_flask_proxy_onrender_com__jit_plugin import getDividends, getFundamentals, getMacro

# 2. Company Announcements
watchlist = ["MNG.LSE", "LGEN.LSE", "PHNX.LSE", "BARC.LSE", "HSBA.LSE", "LLOY.LSE", "MTL.LSE"]
for ticker in watchlist:
    dividends = getDividends(ticker=ticker, from="2025-08-01", to="2025-09-30")
    # Parse dividend ex-dates, payment dates, values
    # If none found ‚Üí leave (P), else replace with real entry

# 3. Macro Announcements
macros = [
    {"code": "USNFP", "label": "US Nonfarm Payrolls"},
    {"code": "USCPI", "label": "US CPI"},
    {"code": "UKGDP", "label": "UK GDP Monthly Estimate"},
    {"code": "ECBMTG", "label": "ECB Policy Meeting"}
]
for m in macros:
    data = getMacro(code=m["code"], from="2025-09-01", to="2025-09-30")
    # Insert event dates into Macro Announcements section

# 4. Update HTML
with open("daily_report_full.html") as f:
    html = f.read()

html = html.replace("M&G ‚Äî Interim Results (P)", "M&G ‚Äî Interim Results, 4 Sep 2025")
# Do the same for other placeholders...

with open("daily_report_full.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(html)
```

### Key Notes
- Keep `(P)` as fallback if no data is returned (avoids empty lines).
- Run fetch step *before* sending email at 06:00 GMT.
- Consider caching API results for stability.

‚úÖ This creates a dynamic pipeline: **data ‚Üí HTML injection ‚Üí send at 06:00 GMT**

## ‚ûï Expanding the Watchlist

The current Daily Report watchlist includes:
- M&G (MNG.LSE)
- Legal & General (LGEN.LSE)
- Phoenix Group (PHNX.LSE)
- Barclays (BARC.LSE)
- HSBC (HSBA.LSE)
- Lloyds (LLOY.LSE)
- Metals Exploration (MTL.LSE)

### How to Add New Tickers
1. **Update Backend Watchlist**
   - Extend the `watchlist` array in your backend script:
     ```python
     watchlist = ["MNG.LSE", "LGEN.LSE", "PHNX.LSE", "BARC.LSE", "HSBA.LSE", "LLOY.LSE", "MTL.LSE", "NEW.LSE"]
     ```

2. **Fetch Data**
   - Ensure new tickers go through the same data fetch process (dividends, fundamentals, prices).

3. **Generate Sparklines**
   - Run the sparkline generator for the new ticker‚Äôs 3M price series.
   - Output a base64 string and embed into HTML:
     ```html
     <img src="data:image/png;base64,BASE64_STRING_HERE" alt="sparkline" />
     ```

4. **Update HTML**
   - Add a new `<tr>` row to the watchlist table in `daily_report_full.html` with the correct fields:
     ```html
     <tr>
       <td>NEW.LSE</td><td>New Company</td><td>XLON</td><td>Price</td><td>MktCap</td>
       <td>DivYld%</td><td>TSR%</td><td>RP Action</td><td>[sparkline]</td>
     </tr>
     ```

### Notes
- Maintain the **same table schema** for consistency.
- If data is missing, mark entries with `(P)` as placeholder.
- Sparklines can be regenerated periodically or daily with updated price data.

‚úÖ This keeps the Watchlist scalable and consistent as you add more companies.

## üö® Error Handling & Troubleshooting

To keep the Daily Report robust, here are common failure points and strategies:

### 1. API Failures (Data Fetch)
- **Problem**: API returns no data (empty response) or times out.
- **Solution**:
  - Default to `(P)` placeholder.
  - Log error for later review (e.g. to a log file or console).
  - Do not break email build; report still sends with placeholders.

```python
try:
    dividends = getDividends(ticker="MNG.LSE", from="2025-08-01", to="2025-09-30")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error fetching dividends for MNG.LSE: {e}")
    dividends = []
```

### 2. Sparkline Generation
- **Problem**: Missing or corrupted price data causes chart to fail.
- **Solution**:
  - Wrap sparkline generator in try/except.
  - If fail, insert a placeholder image or text like "n/a".

### 3. Email Send Failure
- **Problem**: SMTP or SendGrid rejects send.
- **Solution**:
  - Wrap `sendmail` or `sg.send` in try/except.
  - Log failure.
  - Optionally retry once after a short delay.

```python
try:
    server.sendmail(FROM_EMAIL, TO_EMAIL, msg.as_string())
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Send failed: {e}")
```

### 4. HTML Rendering Issues
- **Problem**: Some clients (e.g. Outlook) strip styles or block images.
- **Solution**:
  - Test template across Gmail, Outlook, and iOS Mail.
  - Inline critical CSS where possible.
  - Use absolute URLs for images (S3 hosting) instead of relying solely on base64.

### 5. Cron Job Doesn‚Äôt Fire
- **Problem**: Report not generated at 06:00 GMT.
- **Solution**:
  - Check `cron` log (`/var/log/cron.log` or `journalctl`).
  - Ensure correct timezone is set on server.
  - Confirm Python path (`/usr/bin/python3`) is valid.

‚úÖ With these safeguards, the Daily Report will degrade gracefully (placeholders instead of crashes) and send reliably even if some feeds fail.

## üöÄ Go-Live Checklist

When ready to move from dummy/test reports to production delivery for Sir John, follow this checklist:

### 1. Branding
- [ ] Host Kairos logo on S3 and update `daily_report_full.html` with the public URL.
- [ ] Confirm tagline and header match corporate style guide.

### 2. Data
- [ ] Replace all `(P)` placeholders with live API data feeds for dividends, earnings, and macro events.
- [ ] Verify sparklines are generating correctly with **live price data** (not mock data).
- [ ] Confirm watchlist tickers are correct and up to date.

### 3. Email System
- [ ] Update `TO_EMAIL` in `send_report.py` from your inbox ‚Üí Sir John‚Äôs real email.
- [ ] Test send to a secondary account to confirm formatting works in multiple clients (Gmail, Outlook, iOS Mail).
- [ ] Confirm subject line dynamically shows today‚Äôs date.

### 4. Scheduling
- [ ] Confirm cron job runs daily at **06:00 GMT**.
- [ ] Ensure server timezone is correct (use UTC/GMT to avoid drift).

### 5. Fail-Safes
- [ ] Ensure `(P)` remains as fallback if API data not available (no blank sections).
- [ ] Check error logging for failed sends or API errors.

### 6. Final Validation
- [ ] Send at least **3 consecutive days** of successful dummy reports with live data feeds before enabling Sir John‚Äôs email.
- [ ] Once validated, switch recipient to Sir John.

‚úÖ Once all boxes are ticked, the system is production-ready.

## üåü Future Enhancements Roadmap

The Daily Report system is functional and production-ready, but here are potential enhancements to increase value over time:

### Data & Analytics
- [ ] **Peer Comparisons**: Add valuation vs. sector peers (P/E, EV/EBITDA).
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis**: Pull news sentiment (positive/negative) per watchlist stock.
- [ ] **Broker Targets**: Integrate consensus analyst target prices and ratings.

### Visuals
- [ ] **Mini Charts**: Add bar/line charts for macro trends (e.g. CPI, bond yields).
- [ ] **Heatmaps**: Daily index sector performance in heatmap format.
- [ ] **Interactive Sparklines**: Upgrade from static images to live charts (if viewed in a web dashboard).

### Workflow
- [ ] **User Customisation**: Allow different watchlists per recipient.
- [ ] **Dynamic Filters**: Exclude/include sectors dynamically.
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support**: Reports in English + another language (e.g., French for EU recipients).

### Infrastructure
- [ ] **Database Logging**: Store each day‚Äôs report content for audit and review.
- [ ] **Web Dashboard**: Host a browser-accessible archive of past reports with charts and filters.
- [ ] **Push Notifications**: SMS or mobile alerts for key market events alongside the email.

‚úÖ These are optional enhancements ‚Äî the core pipeline (HTML email with tables, sparklines, and announcements) is stable and sufficient for production.

‚úÖ With this map, each component‚Äôs purpose and place in the pipeline is documented.

## üèó System Architecture Overview

The Daily Report pipeline can be understood in three layers: **Data Sources ‚Üí Backend Processing ‚Üí Delivery**.

### 1. Data Sources
- **Market Data & Fundamentals**: EODHD API (equities, dividends, macros).
- **Macro Data**: FRED, central bank feeds (CPI, NFP, GDP, policy meetings).
- **News**: Reuters, The Times, The Guardian (curated links).
- **FX**: EODHD Forex endpoints.

### 2. Backend Processing
- **Scheduler**: Cron job triggers at 06:00 GMT.
- **Data Fetch**:
  - Pull dividends/earnings per ticker (watchlist).
  - Pull macro announcements (NFP, CPI, ECB, BoE, Fed).
  - Generate sparklines (price series ‚Üí base64 image).
- **HTML Assembly**:
  - Start with `daily_report_full.html` template.
  - Insert fetched data, replacing `(P)` placeholders.
  - Embed sparklines inline.
  - Insert news links dynamically (top 5 general + top 5 financial).
- **Error Handling**:
  - Any failed data fetch = `(P)` placeholder retained.
  - Logged errors for operator review.

### 3. Delivery
- **Email Script** (`send_report.py`):
  - Loads final HTML into MIME message.
  - Includes plain-text fallback (minimal).
  - Sends via:
    - **SMTP** (default, Gmail/Office365/other relay), OR
    - **SendGrid** (API key client).
- **Recipients**:
  - Test mode: operator inbox.
  - Production mode: Sir John Ritblat (plus optional CC/BCC).

### Diagram (Text Form)
```
[ APIs: EODHD / FRED / News ] 
          ‚Üì
   [ Data Fetch Layer ]
          ‚Üì
   [ HTML Assembly (daily_report_full.html) ]
          ‚Üì
   [ send_report.py ]
          ‚Üì
   [ Email via SMTP/SendGrid ]
          ‚Üì
   [ Inbox: Operator (test) ‚Üí Sir John (production) ]
```

‚úÖ This architecture ensures modularity: each layer (data fetch, assembly, delivery) can be upgraded independently without breaking the pipeline.

## üîê Security & Compliance

To ensure the Daily Report system operates securely and within compliance requirements, follow these practices:

### API Keys & Credentials
- **Storage**: Never hardcode API keys or SMTP passwords in scripts.
  - Use environment variables (`export API_KEY=xxxx`).
  - Or load from a `.env` file (with proper `.gitignore` rules).
- **Rotation**: Rotate API keys and passwords periodically (every 90 days recommended).
- **Access Control**: Restrict API keys to required endpoints only (least privilege principle).

### Email Delivery
- **Sender Authentication**:
  - Use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC on sending domain to prevent spoofing.
  - Test deliverability with mail-tester.com before production rollout.
- **Recipient Safety**:
  - Test reports go only to operator inbox until live.
  - Explicit go-live checklist before adding Sir John as recipient.

### Data Handling
- **Personal Data**: The report currently includes no personal/sensitive data.
  - If expanded (e.g., recipient-specific portfolios), GDPR/UK DPA obligations apply.
- **Storage**:
  - If you log or archive past reports, ensure storage is encrypted and access-limited.
  - Retain logs only as long as needed for audit/troubleshooting.

### System Security
- **Server Hardening**:
  - Keep OS and Python libraries up to date.
  - Restrict cron job execution to authorized users only.
- **Error Logs**:
  - Logs may contain error messages but should not store credentials.
  - Review logs regularly for API errors or failed sends.

‚úÖ Following these practices ensures compliance with security best practices and reduces operational risk.

## üõ° Disaster Recovery & Backup Plan

To ensure continuity of the Daily Report system in case of server failure or data loss:

### 1. Code & Templates
- **Freeze Packages**: Keep a copy of each `daily_report_freeze_package.zip` in secure cloud storage (AWS S3, OneDrive, Google Drive).
- **Versioning**: Label each package by date/version (e.g., `daily_report_v1.0_2025-09-01.zip`).
- **Restore**: Unzip into a fresh environment and follow README instructions to rehydrate system.

### 2. Credentials
- **Storage**: Keep SMTP/API credentials in a secure password manager (1Password, Bitwarden).
- **Recovery**: If lost, regenerate API keys and reset SMTP passwords; update environment variables.

### 3. Server Failure
- **Rebuild Steps**:
  1. Spin up replacement server/VM/container.
  2. Install Python 3.x and required libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt` if using one).
  3. Restore latest freeze package from backup.
  4. Reconfigure SMTP/API keys as environment variables.
  5. Restore cron job entry for 06:00 GMT.

### 4. Data & Logs
- **Storage**: If storing historical reports, back them up daily to cloud or external storage.
- **Recovery**: Reload archive for compliance/audit needs.

### 5. Manual Workaround
- If automation fails:
  - Manually run `send_report.py` from operator machine with local HTML file.
  - Ensures report delivery even if scheduler/server is down.

‚úÖ With this plan, the system can be rebuilt and resumed within hours of failure, minimizing downtime.

## ‚ö° Performance & Scalability

The Daily Report system is lightweight, but here are considerations for scaling up:

### 1. Watchlist Expansion
- **Impact**: More tickers = more API calls + more sparklines to generate.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use batch API endpoints where available (reduce HTTP calls).
  - Cache price data if generating sparklines for overlapping tickers.
  - Parallelize API requests with async/threads if needed.

### 2. Recipients
- **Impact**: Sending to more users = higher SMTP/SendGrid throughput.
- **Mitigation**:
  - For <100 recipients: fine with standard SMTP relay.
  - For larger lists: use SendGrid (bulk delivery support, rate limiting).
  - Maintain one HTML template and send in bulk to avoid regenerating per user.

### 3. Report Size
- **Impact**: Large base64 images (sparklines, logo) increase email size.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Keep sparklines small (<10 KB each).
  - Consider external hosting (S3) for charts if email size exceeds ~1MB.

### 4. Processing Time
- **Impact**: More tickers/macros = longer build time.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Profile bottlenecks (API latency vs. local generation).
  - Run data fetch in parallel, assemble HTML at the end.

### 5. Future Enhancements
- **Scaling Path**:
  - For enterprise use: move from cron job ‚Üí workflow manager (Airflow/Luigi).
  - For heavier analytics: offload to cloud function or container service (AWS Lambda, ECS).

‚úÖ Current system easily scales to ~50 tickers and ~500 recipients daily with minimal changes.

## üîÑ Change Management

To ensure updates and new features don‚Äôt disrupt Sir John‚Äôs morning report, follow structured change control:

### 1. Development & Testing
- **Sandbox First**:
  - Test all changes (HTML, sparklines, scripts) in a non-production environment or local machine.
- **Dummy Recipients**:
  - Keep TO_EMAIL pointed at your own inbox until tested for at least 3 consecutive days.

### 2. Versioning
- **Freeze Reports**:
  - Before any major change, create a new `daily_report_freeze_package.zip` with version label (e.g., v1.1).
- **Track Changes**:
  - Update Version History section in README with what changed.

### 3. Deployment
- **Staged Rollout**:
  - Step 1: Deploy to test inbox only.
  - Step 2: Validate output formatting (tables, sparklines, news links).
  - Step 3: Confirm automation (cron 06:00 GMT runs without fail).
- **Final Step**:
  - Update TO_EMAIL ‚Üí Sir John‚Äôs inbox once validated.

### 4. Rollback Plan
- **If an Update Fails**:
  - Revert to the last stable freeze package (unzipped and re-linked).
  - Logs/errors reviewed before retrying rollout.

### 5. Communication
- **Operator Log**:
  - Keep simple notes of changes and outcomes (date, version, issues).
- **Sir John**:
  - Inform recipient only after changes are validated and stable (avoid visible test errors).

‚úÖ This ensures the Daily Report evolves safely, without risk of missed or broken reports in production.

## üì° Monitoring & Alerting

To ensure issues are detected early (before the recipient notices), implement basic monitoring and alerts:

### 1. Logging
- **Email Sends**:
  - Log every attempt (success/failure) with timestamp.
  - Example: `2025-09-01 06:00:01 - Report sent successfully.`
- **API Calls**:
  - Log errors (timeouts, invalid responses) with ticker/code affected.

### 2. Alerts
- **Email Alerts**:
  - On send failure, trigger an alert email to operator inbox (separate from Daily Report).
- **Slack/Teams Alerts** (optional):
  - Use webhook integration to push errors directly into a monitoring channel.

### 3. Health Checks
- **Scheduled Verification**:
  - After cron job runs, send a small ‚Äúping‚Äù log entry (success/failure) to a file or monitoring system.
- **Self-Test Mode**:
  - Add a `--test` flag to `send_report.py` to run a dry-run without sending, just verifying HTML builds.

### 4. Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Track how many reports send successfully per month.
- **Latency**: Measure how long the build + send process takes (should remain <1 min).

### 5. Escalation
- **Immediate**: Operator notified of failed send within minutes.
- **Fallback**: If automation fails, operator can run `send_report.py` manually with local HTML.

‚úÖ With monitoring and alerts in place, you‚Äôll know if something fails at 06:00 GMT ‚Äî and can act before Sir John ever notices.

## üìù Compliance & Audit Trail

To ensure transparency and accountability, maintain a clear record of system runs and changes.

### 1. Run Logs
- **Daily Execution Log**:
  - Record each cron job run with timestamp, success/failure, and recipient.
  - Example: `2025-09-01 06:00 GMT - SUCCESS - Sent to operator@example.com`
- **Error Logs**:
  - Log API errors, send failures, and placeholder insertions.
  - Retain at least 90 days of logs for audit purposes.

### 2. Change Tracking
- **Version History**:
  - Update README "Version History" whenever freeze packages are created.
  - Note what was changed (templates, watchlist, code).  
- **Operator Log** (simple text file):
  - Date, operator, change, outcome.
  - Example: `2025-09-01 - Updated watchlist, added NEW.LSE, tested OK`.

### 3. Backups
- **Freeze Packages**:
  - Store each `daily_report_freeze_package.zip` in cloud storage with version labels.
- **Immutable Storage** (optional):
  - Archive key reports in write-once storage (AWS Glacier, corporate archive).

### 4. Compliance Alignment
- **GDPR/UK DPA**:
  - No personal data currently in use, so minimal compliance requirements.
  - If personalization added, ensure data subject rights (access, deletion) can be fulfilled.
- **Audit-Ready**:
  - System should be able to demonstrate:
    - When each report was generated.
    - To whom it was sent.
    - What data sources were queried.

‚úÖ This creates a defensible audit trail for regulators, auditors, or internal compliance reviews.

## üë• Roles & Responsibilities

To ensure smooth operation and accountability of the Daily Report system, assign clear roles:

### 1. Operator
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Maintain scripts, templates, and freeze packages.
  - Monitor daily sends at 06:00 GMT (check inbox + logs).
  - Troubleshoot API or send failures.
  - Implement updates (watchlist changes, formatting improvements).
- **Authority**:
  - Can make technical changes in test mode.
  - Must log changes in operator log and README version history.

### 2. Approver
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Validate major updates before go-live (e.g., new tickers, format changes).
  - Review go-live checklist before Sir John‚Äôs inbox is enabled.
- **Authority**:
  - Sign off on production deployment changes.

### 3. Recipient (Sir John Ritblat)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - None operationally.
  - Consumer of final Daily Report.
- **Authority**:
  - Feedback on clarity and relevance of content.

### 4. Compliance / Oversight (optional role)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Ensure GDPR/UK DPA compliance if personalization introduced.
  - Review audit trail periodically.
- **Authority**:
  - Can mandate changes to process for regulatory alignment.

‚úÖ Clear separation of duties ensures smooth operation, reduces risk of error, and provides auditability.

## üß≠ Business Continuity

To ensure the Daily Report continues even if the Operator is unavailable:

### 1. Documentation
- **Freeze Packages**:
  - Always keep the latest `daily_report_freeze_package.zip` accessible in shared secure storage.
- **README**:
  - This file serves as the full operations manual. Any competent replacement should be able to follow it.

### 2. Backup Operator
- **Assignment**:
  - Designate a secondary operator with access to scripts, credentials, and cron jobs.
- **Training**:
  - Backup operator should run through dummy sends at least once per month.

### 3. Fallback Delivery
- **Manual Send**:
  - If automation fails and both primary and backup operators unavailable, send a simplified version of the report (static template with placeholders) manually from local machine.
- **Minimum Viable Output**:
  - Rates, indices, FX, and headlines ‚Äî even without sparklines or announcements ‚Äî are acceptable as emergency fallback.

### 4. Escalation
- **Approver Role**:
  - Approver may temporarily act as Operator in exceptional cases (using README and freeze package as guide).
- **Compliance Oversight**:
  - Ensures continuity actions remain documented and compliant.

‚úÖ With backup operator, fallback delivery, and shared documentation, the Daily Report can continue uninterrupted even if the primary Operator is unavailable.

## üì£ Stakeholder Communication

Clear and timely communication ensures trust and transparency with Sir John and other stakeholders.

### 1. Routine
- **Normal Operations**:
  - No need to notify Sir John of daily report mechanics ‚Äî he should only see the polished output.
- **Minor Changes** (formatting tweaks, sparklines updates):
  - No direct notification required, unless it materially changes readability.

### 2. Disruptions
- **Report Delay (short)**:
  - If delivery will be delayed by <2 hours, no notification needed unless repeated.
- **Report Delay (extended)**:
  - If delivery will be missed or delayed beyond 2 hours, notify Sir John with a short note:
    - Example: *"Today‚Äôs Daily Report is delayed due to a system issue. A summary will follow shortly."*
- **Report Failure**:
  - Send emergency fallback (rates, indices, FX, headlines) and note that full version will resume tomorrow.

### 3. Major Changes
- **Watchlist Expansion**:
  - Notify Sir John when new companies are added, framed as an enhancement.
- **Section Additions (charts, sentiment, etc.)**:
  - Inform in advance so expectations are set.
- **Schedule Changes**:
  - Communicate if report timing (06:00 GMT) is altered.

### 4. Escalation
- **Operator ‚Üí Approver**:
  - Operator informs Approver of extended disruptions before contacting Sir John.
- **Approver ‚Üí Sir John**:
  - Approver delivers the client-facing communication if issue is prolonged or recurring.

‚úÖ This approach keeps Sir John informed without burdening him with operational noise, while maintaining confidence in the report‚Äôs reliability.
